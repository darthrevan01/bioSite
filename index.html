    <h2>Summary of Brandi Jordan</h2>
    <p>
        Brandi Jordan, 29, works at Walt Disney World Resort's
        Epcot in World Discovery Attractions and enjoys photography, pin trading,
        and reading as ways to escape and de-stress. Her desire to support friends,
        loved ones, and her dog motivates her daily, while overcoming
        her fear of public speaking through her role as a trainer
        has helped her grow personally and professionally.
