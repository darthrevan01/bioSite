    <h2>About Brandi Jordan</h2>
    <p>
        Brandi Jordan, 29, works for the Walt Disney World Resort at Epcot for World Discovery Attractions.
        Outside of work, she loves photography and is hoping to do more with the hobby as it was part of a
        former job requirement. Brandi also enjoys pin trading at the Disney parks because it allows her to
        make conversation with the cast members, or even fellow Guests that are visiting the park. She calls
        the two of them, alongside a bit of reading, an escape from reality and a way to de-stress and enjoy
        the little things in life. So, what challenges Brandi to getting out of bed every day in order to
        work the hours she is given? Well, she said it is her desire to be there for friends and loved ones,
        and even her dog, is what gets her moving and out of bed. Speaking of friends, there are three
        things she values when having a friendship with someone: honesty, loyalty, and trust. Being able to
        rely on someone, knowing they have your back when you have theirs, will always be a must-have.
        Challenges are what make people who they desire to become and who they are in the present day. One
        challenge for Brandi has always been public speaking. However, since becoming a trainer for her job,
        and wanting to pursue higher positions of power in the resort, it has allowed Brandi to overcome
        that fear and guide her to speak freely, without worry, and train others how to do the job properly.
